# Bitcoin-mechanism--miner-vs.-user
experiment with the Bitcoin mechanism from 2 sides of the users: first as a miner that will implement an alternative pricing mechanism. Then, as a user that is facing the current pay-your-bid mechanism used by the miners, trying to get your transactions into the blockchain as fast as possible at a minimum cost.
